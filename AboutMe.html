                In my early years I loved playing video games much like most everyone else and was facinated on how 
                such things like video games and computer software was created. starting in early middle school, I would begin 
                to explore different avenues of how I could make games and difeerent softwares. I would spend most of my free time
                learning and prototyping different projects, granted none of them were really any good but it is what started 
                my passion for design and programming.
            </p>

                I graduated Highschool from Des Moines Highschool back in 2014 and soon after enrolled
                in the Game Design degree program at Full Sail University to expand on my knowledge of design and programming.
                I would graduate from Full Sail University in September of 2020 with a BA in Game Design.
